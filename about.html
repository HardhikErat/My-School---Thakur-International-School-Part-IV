    <h3>As we witness the dawn of a new millennium, we see globalization entering everywhere.</h3>
    <h3>It is our loudest and boldest reality; the world has turned into a global village.</h3>
    <h3>Advancements in information technology and other computer applications have reduced</h3>
    <h3>distances to unbelievable proportions. Availability of tremendous amounts of information</h3>
    <h3>at the click of a button has radically changed the perception of learners about education</h3>
    <h3>and educational institutes.</h3><br>
    <h3>At the Zagdu Singh Charitable Trust, we believe that Thakur International School moulds</h3>
    <h3>and celebrates a new generation of successful professionals who will serve and improve</h3>
    <h3>society in the emerging scenario, and contribute significantly to nation building. In</h3>
    <h3>order to achieve this aim, Thakur International School has made sure that its students</h3>
    <h3>enjoy the best of infrastructural facilities and a competent teaching faculty.</h3><br>
    <h3>I am confident that the enriching academic ambience at Thakur International School will</h3>
    <h3>make learning a delightful experience for all its students, and push them onto achieving</h3>
    <h3>greater heights.</h3><br>

    <h1><b>TRUSTEE'S MESSAGE</b></h1>
    <h3>Kites rise highest against the wind not with it......................... -Winston Churchill</h3><br>
    <h3>"Don't aim for success, if you want it, just do what you love and believe in and it will</h3>
    <h3>come naturally." says David Frost.</h3><br>

    <h3>The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking</h3>
    <h3>down your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable components and then starting on the first one.</h3><br>
    <h3>We are familiar with the concept of sowing and reaping in agriculture. Similarly at Thakur International School,</h3>
    <h3>we sow thoughts and reap actions. The thoughts that cross the minds of our students even in their leisure,</h3>
    <h3>influences their personality.</h3><br>
    <h3>Positive thoughts create positive actions which are assets. These assets enable our students to be level</h3>
    <h3>headed and stable in both tough and easy situations. They are major contributors to a strong, vigorous,</h3>
    <h3>healthy mind and body.</h3><br>
    <h3>Students are empowered to make up their mind about their future goals and hold onto that vision. Both</h3>
    <h3>staff and students are trained to understand what it takes to reach the pinnacle of excellence.</h3><br>
    <h3>Therefore, one should not be afraid to give one's best to the seemingly insignificant job. Each time</h3>
    <h3>you conquer one it, makes you that much, more strong. If you do the little jobs well, the big ones</h3>
    <h3>will take care of themselves. Hence the need for microplanning in order to ensure macro success!</h3>
    <h3>Remember if you want the best the world has to offer; offer the world your best. We must aim above</h3>
    <h3>the mark to hit the mark.</h3><br>
    <h3>I thank the Chairman, the Principal, staff, students and parents for their continued cooperation and</h3>
    <h3>support to the Thakur International School.</h3><br>
    <h3>Mrs. Varsha Singh.</h3><br>
